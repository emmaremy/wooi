      <p>
        The Wooi language is spoken by approximately two hundred people on central Yapen Island in Cenderawasih Bay, West Papua, Indonesia (Yapen Island is red in the below image). Papua is home to hundreds of languages that are slowly being lost in favor of Indonesian. The <a href="http://www.celd-papua.net/">Center for Endangered Languages Documentation (CELD)</a> associated with <a href="http://www.unipa.ac.id/">Universitas Papua (UNIPA)</a> is working to preserve these languages and the cultures associated with them through documentation and linguistic analysis.

        As part of these efforts, this website teaches some of the basics of Wooi, as found through consultation with and recording of native Wooi speaker Jimmi Karter Kirihio, a CELD employee. Many thanks to Jimmi for his time and voice, Professor Emily Gasser for all of her guidance and patience, Swarthmore College's Joel Dean Summer Research Fellowship for making this project possible, and everyone else who  put up with my limited knowledge of Indonesian.
