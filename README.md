# wooi
A very in progress website teaching the basics of Bahasa Wooi. Please don't look to hard at my very bad Papuan-dialect Indonesian or my poorly-formatted HTML.

This was initially created using Mozilla Thimble while I taught myself the basics of CSS, hence the currently poorly-formatted HTML.

In the future, my plans for this project are to:
* move to Jekyll
* translate the currently existing English pages to Papuan Malay
* add content to the "Lessons"
